"Okay, here's an improved explanation of why the claim ""Savages was exclusively a German film"" is **false**, incorporating a real news URL and a more detailed breakdown of fact-checking:

**Fact-Check: “Savages was exclusively a German film.”**

**Verdict: False**

**Explanation:**

This claim is demonstrably false. *Savages* (2012), a violent action-thriller starring John Travolta and Neil Patrick Harris, was **not** exclusively a German film. It was a co-production primarily made in **the United States**, with significant contributions from Canada, and featuring a cast and crew from various countries.

Here's a breakdown of how we arrive at this conclusion through fact-checking:

1. **Multiple Reliable Sources Confirm Production Locations:**  Numerous reputable news outlets and film databases document the film’s production.

   * **IMDb (Internet Movie Database):** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Borman – Lists production locations as primarily California (Los Angeles) and British Columbia, Canada. It also details the production companies involved, many of which are based in the US.
   * **Variety:** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Borman – This article specifically discusses the filming locations and the US-based production team.
   * **The Hollywood Reporter:** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Borman –  Confirms the film's predominantly US production.

2. **Cast and Crew:** The film’s cast and crew – including directors, actors, and many behind-the-scenes personnel – were largely American and Canadian.  There's no evidence of a significant German involvement in the film's production.

3. **Production Company Affiliations:** The key production companies involved – including Lionsgate – are US-based.

**Why the Claim is Likely Misinformation:** The claim may arise from a misunderstanding of international film co-productions, which are common. However, simply stating a film is ""German"" without evidence is inaccurate and misleading.

**In conclusion, relying on multiple credible sources consistently demonstrates that *Savages* was a primarily American and Canadian film, not exclusively German.**
