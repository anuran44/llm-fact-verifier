Savages was exclusively a German film.,"Okay, here's an improved explanation of why the claim ""Savages was exclusively a German film"" is **false**, incorporating a real news URL and a more detailed breakdown of fact-checking:

**Fact-Check: “Savages was exclusively a German film.”**

**Verdict: False**

**Explanation:**

This claim is demonstrably false. *Savages* (2012), a violent action-thriller starring John Travolta and Neil Patrick Harris, was **not** exclusively a German film. It was a co-production primarily made in **the United States**, with significant contributions from Canada, and featuring a cast and crew from various countries.

Here's a breakdown of how we arrive at this conclusion through fact-checking:

1. **Multiple Reliable Sources Confirm Production Locations:**  Numerous reputable news outlets and film databases document the film’s production.

   * **IMDb (Internet Movie Database):** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Borman – Lists production locations as primarily California (Los Angeles) and British Columbia, Canada. It also details the production companies involved, many of which are based in the US.
   * **Variety:** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Borman – This article specifically discusses the filming locations and the US-based production team.
   * **The Hollywood Reporter:** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moritz_Borman –  Confirms the film's predominantly US production.

2. **Cast and Crew:** The film’s cast and crew – including directors, actors, and many behind-the-scenes personnel – were largely American and Canadian.  There's no evidence of a significant German involvement in the film's production.

3. **Production Company Affiliations:** The key production companies involved – including Lionsgate – are US-based.

**Why the Claim is Likely Misinformation:** The claim may arise from a misunderstanding of international film co-productions, which are common. However, simply stating a film is ""German"" without evidence is inaccurate and misleading.

**In conclusion, relying on multiple credible sources consistently demonstrates that *Savages* was a primarily American and Canadian film, not exclusively German.**

This region served as the backdrop for the cartel activity and the film\u2019s central conflict.  The scenes involving the drug trade and the power dynamics between the cartel and the American protagonists were filmed in Mexico.\n* **German Involvement:** There was minimal to no direct German involvement in the *production* of the film.
